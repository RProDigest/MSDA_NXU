This code contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of Logistic Regression on the breast cancer dataset. The notebook provides a detailed workflow from data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.



## Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a statistical method for predicting binary outcomes from data. It is widely used in various fields for classification problems. In this study, we use this algorithm for predicting breast cancer
## Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- python 3.12.x 

The piece of code below shows how install the libraries assuming you already have python installed. Incase you do not have python on your system please visit the following link and follow the installation instructions: https://www.python.org/downloads/

If you have an existing  installation of python, you might need to upgrade your version of pip (package installer for python ) at the command prompt

```python
python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

1.0 INSTALL THE NECESSARY PYTHON LIBRARIES

```python
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn 
```


## Import the dataset

- Load the breast cancer dataset from scikit-learn library as shown below.

```python
breast_cancer = datasets.load_breast_cancer() # This line imports the breast cancer dataset from the 'dataset' module in scikit-learn

```
- Ensure you have read and write access to the directory.


## How to run the Notebook

- Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
