<p><strong><em>Assignment: Module 2</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Assignment Solution Starts Here</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>1.0 Install library for fast Exploratory Data Analysis in Python</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>2. Let us load the libraries needed for this assignment</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>3.0 Check working directory and ensure dataset is in the working directory</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Read in the employee dataset as a pandas dataframe called employee_df</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>4.0 Let us have a quick view using EDA, as this is good practice in Data Analytics</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>The dataset from the EDA above shows the following insights:</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li>High Correlation between Total Pay and Total Pay Benefits as expected</li>
<li>BasePay is an unsupported type, check if it needs cleaning or further analysis   Unsupported</li>
<li>OvertimePay is an unsupported type, check if it needs cleaning or further analysis   Unsupported</li>
<li>OtherPay is an unsupported type, check if it needs cleaning or further analysis  Unsupported</li>
<li>Benefits is an unsupported type, check if it needs cleaning or further analysis</li>
</ol>

<p>Items 2 to 5 suggest data quality issues and might need some attention especially in cases where data computation would be needed </p>

<p><strong><em>5.0 Let us create the employee function , that returns employee details, has dictionary processing and error handling.</em></strong> </p>

<p><strong><em>6.0 Let us export the empolyee details as required by the question as a zipped csv file</em></strong></p>
